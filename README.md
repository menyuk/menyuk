- 👋 Hi, I’m @menyuk
- 👀 I’m interested in computational photonics
- 🌱 I’m currently do research on solitons and frequency combs in microresonators and lasers
- 🌱 I am also doing research on photodetectors and their applications
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on dynamical methods for studying noise and stabiity in frequency comb devices
- 📫 I can be reached at menyuk@umbc.edu
